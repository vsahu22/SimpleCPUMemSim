This project simulates a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and memory. 
The CPU and memory are simulated by different processes that communicate with each other through pipes, and the memory contains a program that will be executed by the CPU, after which the simulation ends.
The sample.txt file is a sample program that can be loaded into memory for this project. The sample program calculates the factorial of 10.
